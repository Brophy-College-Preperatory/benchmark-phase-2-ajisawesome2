    <img align="right" width="650" height="300" src="/assets/Screenshot 2024-11-07 at 2.16.01‚ÄØPM.png">
<h2>HERE ARE 5 OVERRATED PLAYERS:</h2>
    

    <p>1. Russell Westbrook </p>
    <p>2. Andrew Wiggins</p>
    <p>3. Bronny James</p>
    <p>4. Micheal Porter Jr.</p>
    <p>5. Ben Simmons</p>
   
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>HERE ARE THE PLAYERS STATS IN THE NBA (WORST SEASON):</h2>
   
  <p>Russell Westbrook- In Russell Westbrook's 2 previous seasons we see they are the worst of his whole career!</p>
  <p>11.7 PPG, 4 RPG, 4.5 APG, 27% 3PT</p>
  <p>Yikes that's horrible are you sure that one of your favorite players he is on a downfall right now.üòü</p>
  <p>Andrew Wiggins- Same with Andrew Wiggins, his most recent 2023-2024 season hase been the worst out of his 11 year season.</p>
  <img align="right" width="550" height="300" src="assets/Screenshot 2024-11-10 at 12.26.54‚ÄØPM.png"
  <p>13.2 PPG, 4.5 RPG, 1.7 APG, 35.8% 3PT</p>
  <p>Ouch, see how his stats have been decreasing ever since his early seasons.üò≥</p>
  <p>Bronny James- Bronny has played 5 games this season and that stats arnt to great.</p>
  <p>0.8 PPG, 0.2 RPG, 0.4 APG, 0% 3PT</p>
  <p>Are you sure he is going to be the next G.O.A.T, he is horrible compared to other rookies like Rob Dillingham.ü§®</p>
  <p>Micheal Porter Jr.- Often called ballhog, is not the best player in the league in my opinion.</p>
  <p>18.1 PPG, 7.0 RPG, 2.8 APG, 41.4% 3PT</p>
  <p>As you can see he is not the worst player on the list but I included him cause HE DOES NOT PASS.üòñ</p>
  <p>Ben Simmons- Ha Ha Ha, last but not least Ben Simmons, just look at these atrocious stats these last 3 years.</p>
  <p>6.1 PPG, 6 RPG, 5.7 APG, 0% 3PT.</p>
  <p>ARE YOU SERIOUSLY NOT TELLING ME HE IS OVERRATED! Maybe he should even retire if he keeps these stats up.ü´£</p>
  <br>
  <h2>FRAUDS..?</h2>

  
  <br>
  <h2>HERE ARE REASONS WHY I THINK THESE PLAYERS ARE CONSIDERED OVERRATED:</h2>
  <br>
  <p>RUSSELL WESTBROOK</p>
  <p>REASON- Some reasons I think Russell Westbrook is overrated is that Russell has won 4 playoff games ever! He has never gotten his team out of the first round.</p>
  <p>Also, remember when people used to call him Westbrick, oh yeah I forgot to mention he can't make shots regulary, or in clutch moments.</p>
  <p>So you see now, he is overrated and that doesn't mean you don't have to dislike him as a person, just maybe a player. </p>
  <br>
  <p>ANDREW WIGGINS</p>
  <p>REASON- I love Andrew Wiggins and he is a great guy, but he is starting to slack a little bit.</p>
    <img align="right" width="450" height="600" src="assets/Screenshot 2024-11-10 at 12.38.47‚ÄØPM.png"
    <p>If your having starting to have guards average more rebounds than you, that a subtle forshadow that something is going wrong.</p>
  <p>As you can look in the stats above, he averages the 2nd least rebounds, and he is a PF.</p>
  <p>That just shows to me he is leaning into the category of overrated.</p>
  <br>
  <p>BRONNY JAMES</p>
  <p>REASON- Ok Ok, I know it is early and all, but Bronny James had so much hype and fame to live up to, that he didn't</p>
  <p>He is just not ready for the NBA, and just because he is Lebron James's son, he is already considered the next best.</p>
  <p>He is just a little overrated and I beleive this is because he has such. high standards due to this being the first Father-Son duo on the same team, playing together.</p>
  <br>
  <p>MICHEAL PORTER JR.</p>
  <p>REASON- Now Micheal Porter Jr. might be the best player on this list, I still believe he is overrated.</p>
  <p>The reason I say this is because he is simliar to Westbrook, he can not make a shot, and worse than that he does not pass the ball.</p>
  <p>Many people started to chant overrated when they were in the Finals and he kept slacking, whether it was missing easy shots, or not passing to the open guy.</p>
  <br>
  <p>BEN SIMMONS</p>
  <p>REASON- Last but not least, Ben Simmons, in my opinion he is the most overrated player on this list, maybe not even overrated just bad!</p>
  <p>Ben Simmons was THE FIRST OVERALL PICK, and he is putting up numbers like this! Are your serious!
  <p>He has the 2nd worst stats on this list, behind a rookie, that's embarresing.</p>
  <p>People have been telling him to retire ever since it started get bad and it hasn't got much better.</p>
  </p>
