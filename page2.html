<h2>HERE ARE THE PLAYERS STATS IN THE NBA (WORST SEASON):</h2>
   
  <p>Russell Westbrook- In Russell Westbrook's 2 previous seasons we see they are the worst of his whole career!</p>
  <p>11.7 PPG, 4 RPG, 4.5 APG, 27% 3PT</p>
  <p>Yikes that's horrible are you sure that one of your favorite players he is on a downfall right now.ðŸ˜Ÿ</p>
  <p>Andrew Wiggins- Same with Andrew Wiggins, his most recent 2023-2024 season hase been the worst out of his 11 year season.</p>
  <img align="right" width="550" height="300" src="assets/Screenshot 2024-11-10 at 12.26.54â€¯PM.png"
  <p>13.2 PPG, 4.5 RPG, 1.7 APG, 35.8% 3PT</p>
  <p>Ouch, see how his stats have been decreasing ever since his early seasons.ðŸ˜³</p>
  <p>Bronny James- Bronny has played 5 games this season and that stats arnt to great.</p>
  <p>0.8 PPG, 0.2 RPG, 0.4 APG, 0% 3PT</p>
  <p>Are you sure he is going to be the next G.O.A.T, he is horrible compared to other rookies like Rob Dillingham.ðŸ¤¨</p>
  <p>Micheal Porter Jr.- Often called ballhog, is not the best player in the league in my opinion.</p>
  <p>18.1 PPG, 7.0 RPG, 2.8 APG, 41.4% 3PT</p>
  <p>As you can see he is not the worst player on the list but I included him cause HE DOES NOT PASS.ðŸ˜–</p>
  <p>Ben Simmons- Ha Ha Ha, last but not least Ben Simmons, just look at these atrocious stats these last 3 years.</p>
  <p>6.1 PPG, 6 RPG, 5.7 APG, 0% 3PT.</p>
  <p>ARE YOU SERIOUSLY NOT TELLING ME HE IS OVERRATED! Maybe he should even retire if he keeps these stats up.ðŸ«£</p>
