<h2>HERE ARE REASONS WHY I THINK THESE PLAYERS ARE CONSIDERED OVERRATED:</h2>
  <br>
  <p>RUSSELL WESTBROOK</p>
  <p>REASON- Some reasons I think Russell Westbrook is overrated is that Russell has won 4 playoff games ever! He has never gotten his team out of the first round.</p>
  <p>Also, remember when people used to call him Westbrick, oh yeah I forgot to mention he can't make shots regulary, or in clutch moments.</p>
  <p>So you see now, he is overrated and that doesn't mean you don't have to dislike him as a person, just maybe a player. </p>
  <br>
  <p>ANDREW WIGGINS</p>
  <p>REASON- I love Andrew Wiggins and he is a great guy, but he is starting to slack a little bit.</p>

    <p>If your having starting to have guards average more rebounds than you, that a subtle forshadow that something is going wrong.</p>
  <p>As you can look in the stats above, he averages the 2nd least rebounds, and he is a PF.</p>
  <p>That just shows to me he is leaning into the category of overrated.</p>
  <br>
  <p>BRONNY JAMES</p>
  <p>REASON- Ok Ok, I know it is early and all, but Bronny James had so much hype and fame to live up to, that he didn't</p>
  <p>He is just not ready for the NBA, and just because he is Lebron James's son, he is already considered the next best.</p>
  <p>He is just a little overrated and I beleive this is because he has such. high standards due to this being the first Father-Son duo on the same team, playing together.</p>
  <br>
  <p>MICHEAL PORTER JR.</p>
  <p>REASON- Now Micheal Porter Jr. might be the best player on this list, I still believe he is overrated.</p>
  <p>The reason I say this is because he is simliar to Westbrook, he can not make a shot, and worse than that he does not pass the ball.</p>
  <p>Many people started to chant overrated when they were in the Finals and he kept slacking, whether it was missing easy shots, or not passing to the open guy.</p>
  <br>
  <p>BEN SIMMONS</p>
  <p>REASON- Last but not least, Ben Simmons, in my opinion he is the most overrated player on this list, maybe not even overrated just bad!</p>
  <p>Ben Simmons was THE FIRST OVERALL PICK, and he is putting up numbers like this! Are your serious!
  <p>He has the 2nd worst stats on this list, behind a rookie, that's embarresing.</p>
  <p>People have been telling him to retire ever since it started get bad and it hasn't got much better.</p>
  </p>
